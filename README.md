# PROJECT ALONE

As part of my studies in the nineth semester at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin, three classmates and I developed a First-Person-Shooter / Horror-Game called <strong>ALONE</strong> with the gaming engine Unity in C#.
<br/><br/>
We had three months for the developing and <strong>my part was to program the enemies and player movement, health and attack, as well as the player's shooting - plus weapon recoil, weapon switching and ammunition boxes</strong>.
